#summary install short notes for running a server production instance

see also [VMwareHome]

The below notes assume installation on a server running *VMware ESXi 4.0*, for further notes on ESXi, other VMware or virtualization products see earlier notes at [VMwareInstall]

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

= Setup =

== ip setting ==

The {{{ifconfig}}} command will tell you which ethernet device the server is trying to communicate on({{{ifconfig -a}}} will show all available devices).  For mine the host server was running 'eth0' and the virtual was running 'eth5'

from http://forums.techarena.in/operating-systems/1106661.htm

== static ip ==

for the host the static IP is 129.252.37.90 

In host file /etc/network/interfaces
{{{
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
address 129.252.37.90
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.252.37.1
}}}

Then restart network with 
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}

Running 'ifconfig' command from virtual host listed ethernet as 'eth5' which is substituted for the 'eth0' and run in the same steps listed above for configuring the static IP for the host except now on the virtual server.

I did not have to modify the defaulted dns file settings for host or virtual server files under /etc/resolv.conf 

== dynamic ip (dhcp) ==

Discover the ethernet device that the server is trying to communicate on using the `ifconfig` command as detailed above(device is eth0 in the example below).

In host file /etc/network/interfaces
{{{
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
}}}

Then restart network with 
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}


----
== openssh ==

*required section if ssh access from other networks/IP's is needed*

The initial image runs an openssh daemon which accepts no outside connects via the /etc/hosts.allow file below.  Modify the hosts.allow,hosts.deny files as necessary for access/security purposes.

file /etc/hosts.allow
{{{
#uncomment below line and add substitute your http ip below for ssh access
#sshd : xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx : allow
sshd : ALL : deny
}}}

----
== image default users, passwords ==

*required section for security purposes*

#reset user passwds to public defaults - user,root,xeniaprod,postgres - as root, passwd <username>

The *root* user has password *root99*.  Modify this password as needed.

The *postgres* user has password *postgres99*.  Modify this password as needed.

The username associated with the xenia development is *xeniaprod* with password *xeniaprod99*  Modify this password as needed.

The username *user* has password *user99* although this user account is not utilized.  Modify this password as needed.

Both users *xeniaprod* and *user* are part of the *admin* group ({{{sudo vi /etc/group}}}) which is a 'sudo' ({{{sudo vi /etc/sudoers}}}) enabled group.

*optional* see the other gisvm related passwords [http://www.vmware.com/appliances/directory/55606 here] and modify as needed.

----
== host substitutions, configuration ==

*Required section for configuring image to use local IP,system/database passwords and understanding data flow*

*By default as a test, on initial image startup this image will begin trying to hourly access over the web a few kmz files(usgs,nerrs,ndbc) for aggregation to the xenia database and production of several output formats and services.  Check 'flow_' output graphs(.png) under http://localhost/xenia/feeds or http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xenia/feeds after a few hours to verify feed processing/population.*

If you plan to run a production xenia vmware instance accessible by others on the web, search the xeniaprod code from the following directory to see the necessary localhost substitutions(for your production machine http address) or other configuration options.

replace *your_ip* in the below line commands with your IP (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
{{{
cd /home/xeniaprod
find . -name "*" -exec grep -H "VM_CONFIG" {} \; 
perl -p -i -e 's/129.252.37.90/your_ip/g' `find ./ -name "*.pl"`
perl -p -i -e 's/129.252.37.90/your_ip/g' `find ./ -name "*.html"`
perl -p -i -e 's/129.252.37.90/your_ip/g' `find ./ -name "*.xml"`
}}}

{{{
search for #VM_CONFIG in effected files

/etc/hosts.allow  #ssh ip access
/etc/exports #nfs remote mount access

#postgres

user passwds - postgres,xeniaprod
psql -U postgres -h xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
alter user postgres with password 'xxx';
alter user xeniaprod with password 'xxx';

#enable #VM_CONFIG ip addresses

#enable feeds as needed

search for #VM_CONFIG in effected crons (as user 'xeniaprod', crontab -e)
#start crons - root, xeniaprod

check output graphs(.png) under http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xenia/feeds after a few hours to verify feed processing/population

}}}

----
== miscellaneous ==

*informational section*

*sudo* all commands that need root access.

To sudo between users, use the first user password(user99 in the below example) not the target user password
{{{
user@gisvm:~$ sudo su - xeniaprod
[sudo] password for user:
xeniaprod@gisvm:~$ 
}}}

The *two crontabs* which are active are *root* which performs a nightly cleanup of files under directory /home/xeniaprod/tmp_web and *xeniaprod* which also performs file cleanup but more importantly runs the following main job hourly.

The file */home/xeniaprod/cron/xeniaflow.sh* creates all the subsequent related products and should be referenced to understand the product creation flow.

Xenia related log files are at /home/xeniaprod/tmp and cleared nightly.

Apache user(www-data) created related temporary files are at /home/xeniaprod/tmp_web and cleared nightly.

== ObsKML ==
