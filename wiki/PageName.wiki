#summary General Python Notes

= Purpose =

Just some general notes on various Python tasks I constantly forget and will now document.


= Pip =
== Install ==
If you need to pass include or library directories along to the setup.py during pip install, --global-install is your huckleberry.
AN example of passing pymssql the directories where I had installed FreeTDS:
{{{
pip install pymssql --global-option=build_ext --global-option="--include-dirs=/Users/.../local/freetds/include" --global-option="--library-dirs=/Users/.../local/freetds/lib"

}}}
