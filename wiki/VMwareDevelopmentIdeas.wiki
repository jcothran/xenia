== June 5, 2009 ==

  * migrate focus back to postgresql from sqlite for latest/recent 2 weeks to help resolve multi-user, database/process contention issues - may still keep archives as weekly julian data sqlite files
  * migrate away from ObsKML as intermediate XML import/export format, simple CSV files/resultsets are probably easier/simpler to produce and comprehend

= Long term = 

  * Other languages, databases, frameworks
    * Redevelop existing scripts and add additional scripts in popular languages/frameworks such as *python, java/J2EE, .NET*, etc
    * Redevelop scripts to allow connection to a variety of different backend relational databases (*Oracle,SQL Server,PostgreSQL,MySQL,Sqlite*)
  * Registry/Catalog of other ObsKML data providers or Xenia VMware instances
  * currently using gnuplot for graph images, would also like to provide more interactive/dynamic client-side type plots such as Google's [http://code.google.com/apis/chart/types.html Chart API] or [http://code.google.com/apis/visualization/documentation/examples.html Visualization API]
  * migration to Xen http://xen.org type multiple virtualized servers and cloud computing such as [http://tim.dysinger.net/2007/07/28/migrating-your-virtual-debian-server-from-xen-to-ec2/ EC2]
