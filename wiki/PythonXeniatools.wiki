#summary The Python scripts that makeup xeniatools.

= Introduction =

To make sure various Python scripts I create can re-use common code, I needed a place to store the scripts that the Python environment could find. Python has a site-packages directory that is a common location, so I created a xeniatools directory to house my various utilities. Xeniatools is a bit of a misnomer as I have scripts that do alot more than just interact with the Xenia database.

For brevity's sake "External Dependencies" are other Python packages I had to install. "Internal Dependencies" are Python objects developed in house, and most likely living in the xeniatools directory.

This is the brains of our QAQC processing. It doesn't have a '__main__' function, it is just a container for the various classes used for doing the QAQC.
