  * News items?
  * Email/phone contact info?
  * changes? - about page
  * changes? - partnership page

= Homepage =

  * possible upcoming logo, color styling changes
  * search bar not currently functional
  * site 'feedback' tab not functional

----
= Learn =

  * need content verbiage for 'Habitat Conservation'

= Catalog =

  * Jesse
    * 'view' opens to layer zoom/extent(include layer extent info in config?)
    * 'view' opens in active tab

----
= Visualize =

  * still working to display up the *raw* bathmetry data and CVI (Coastal Vulnerability Index) layers.
  * some layer names are acronyms and need to be renamed to something better understood and less cryptic.
  * Missing legends - these are the legends that don't support the REST legend request:
    * All Restrictions 
    * Black Sea Bass Pots Restrictions 
    * Bottom Longlines Restrictions 
    * Commercial Fishing Seasons and Closures 
    * Federal OCS Administrative Boundaries 
    * Fish Traps Restrictions 
    * Limit of OCSLA \u20188(g)\u2019 zone 
    * OCS Lease Blocks 
    * OCS Protraction Diagrams 
    * Octocoral Gear Restrictions 
    * Recreational Fishing Seasons and Closures 
    * Roller Rig Trawls Restrictions 
    * Sargassum Restrictions 
    * Submerged Land Acts Boundary 

  * map extents
    * initial map extent shifted southward, focus on 4 state region
    * query extents limited to GSAA 4-state region

  * query/identify tool - when user clicks on the map, info is displayed about that point on the map
    * for Marco this is done using UTFGrid which is a pre-processing step on the data layers to grid-subset and provide a client-cached summary file(JSON) that is downloaded alongside the map image.  This functionality also supports mouse 'hover' since the summary grid data is resident on the client.
    * for our initial approach, we would be using ESRI's Query and Geoprocessing API's to make a dynamic web services request(on mouse click) against the remote server associated with the data layer
    * we could assume all 'active' layers should be queried or allow a layer selection method(checkbox?) for layers that should be queried
    * query info displayed as a pop-up?
