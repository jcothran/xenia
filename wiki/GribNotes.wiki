#summary notes on using wgrib2

rename x test.grb

wgrib2.exe test.grb

wgrib2 -v test.grb

wgrib2.exe -grid test.grb

#lon displayed as negative, temperature in Kelvin
./wgrib2 test.grb -d 1 -small_grib -90:-65 23:40 small.grb

./wgrib2 small.grb -d 1 -csv hey2.csv

----

The grib stuff so far seems to have about a 100 to 1 compression ratio for binary to text, so be careful converting a 8 MB grib file to 800 MB text/csv file.  wgrib2 is the command line tool I'm using to go from grib to text/csv

There's PyGrib also but PyNIO seemed to cover more formats with grib,netcdf,hdf
