Descriptions of various feed methods and feeds available to a Xenia database instance.

----
== Feed methods ==

Currently there are three methods for feeding (or populating) your Xenia database with a population of organziations, platforms, sensors and observation measurements.

----
=== Create a direct feeds ===

The first method is to create scripts which directly converts the raw data feed into SQL which you would populate your xenia instance with.  This is the most direct method, but I'd recommend the second method of creating an intermediate ObsKML file which could be shared as part of a community of shared feeds.

=== Use an existing SQL feed ===

I have repurposed some earlier code to provide an hourly data 'feed' of .sql files which others should be able to utilize to populate additional xenia database instances(postgresql or sqlite) similar to the database which I'm running at USC.
