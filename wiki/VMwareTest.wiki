= Download the vmware player =

== Windows ==

Goto vmware player download page at http://www.vmware.com/download/player/download.html and download, install windows version(2.5.1 tested)

== Linux ==

Goto vmware player download page http://www.vmware.com/download/player/download.html and download the Linux version 2.5.1(the 32-bit, not 64-bit) .bundle file

Used the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VMware/Player for guidance, only had to run the following line

gksudo bash ./VMware-Player-2.5.1-126130.i386.bundle
}}}

= Download the vmware image instance =

The latest vmware image(version 1.0, rar-compressed size x) is available at http://carocoops.org/vmware/x

This vmware image was developed on top of the FOSS geospatial vmware image(geostatistics package which includes 'R') available at http://gisvm.com - thanks to Ricardo Pinho.

While the Xenia scripts do not directly utilize/interact those included applications in the gisvm image at this time, I thought they represent the best existing collection of FOSS geospatial software for future development.

= Substitutions =

= Adding a new ObsKML feed =

So the existing sample USGS and NERRS feeds are flowing correctly and you are ready to try adding another feed.

Note the following currently available ObsKML feeds at http://carocoops.org/obskml/feeds/
  * nos (National Ocean Service - Tides and Currents)
  * nws (National Weather Service)
  * usf (University of South Florida)
  * nccoos (North Carolina Coastal Ocean Observing System)
  * cormp (UNCS Coastal Ocean Research and Monitoring Program)
  * carocoops (Carolinas Coastal Ocean Observing and Prediction System)
  * wq  (this is Southeast USGS coastal stations)
  * nerrs (National Estuarine Research Reserve System)
  * vos (NOAA Volutary Observing Ships)

The following example demonstrates adding the hourly [http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ NDBC] ObsKML feed as available from 

http://carocoops.org/obskml/feeds/ndbc/ndbc_latest_obskml.zip

{{{
create nerrs folders (nerrs, nerrs/archive)
wget latest nerrs obskml
archive cleanup

add getObskml.sh
add styleLatest.sh

#check_status - array, graph spots
}}}

= Example scripts for generating ObsKML =

Here are some example scripts detailing how to create ObsKML from several data source types

Note that the ObsKML schema does not currently utilize an 'obskml' namespace convention but may in a future version.
