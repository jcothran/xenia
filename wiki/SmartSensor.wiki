#Notes from the Smart Sensor conference
  * Defining Interoperability
    # Benefits?
      * Marketing edge? Why do it? Mostly for the users.
      
    # Mfg update on sensors
    # Create working group
    # Meaning of interoperability
      * Plug it in and go
      * Interface? Which type, electrical, mechanical, hardware, software.
      * Sensor interoperability, System interoperability, what is the dividing line?
      * Black box approach?
      * Smart sensors? Only have a couple of settings.
      * Is physical connection important? Environment dictates connector.
    #MBARI 
      *Instruments are interperable with each other if:
        *thier data can be accessed through a common interface, orocessed and compared   with a common set if tools.
        *they can be configured and operatted though a common interface.
      * Different mfgs implement their own protocols.
      * Stndard observatory protocl
        * COmmoand protocol to configure and interact with instrument: IEEE-1451, OGC Sesnsor Panning service
        * Standard data format
        * Standard metadata format
      * Implement driver to sit between sensor and host.
        * Dirver on host, non-standard instrument firmware
          * Advantages
            -Can accommodate very diverse instruments
            -Instrument frmware is immune to observatory protocol changes.
          * Disadvantages
            -Driver devel is complex
            -Driver must be installed and configured on instrument host
            -Firmware may not conform to observatory standard.
          * WHo writes the driver?
         * Standard instrument firmware
           * Instrument and its data/metadata automatically integrated into observatory without driver. Low cost to integrate
           *Comprehensive standard spec can be complex.
            - Implementers mst understand spec.
            - Firmware implementation can be complex
            - Reference implementation needed
           * Observatory protocol standards are still evolving.
             - Need to update firmware
             - Embedded programming
             - How to update on deployed instruments.
         * PUCK
           * Provides a protocol and container to store instrument-related info.
