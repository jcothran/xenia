#Notes from the Smart Sensor conference
  * Defining Interoperability
    # Benefits?
      * Marketing edge? Why do it? Mostly for the users.
      
    # Mfg update on sensors
    # Create working group
    # Meaning of interoperability
      * Plug it in and go
      * Interface? Which type, electrical, mechanical, hardware, software.
      * Sensor interoperability, System interoperability, what is the dividing line?
      * Black box approach?
      * Smart sensors? Only have a couple of settings.
      * Is physical connection important? Environment dictates connector.
    # MBARI 
      * Instruments are interperable with each other if:
        * Their data can be accessed through a common interface, orocessed and compared   with a common set if tools.
        * They can be configured and operated though a common interface.
      * Different mfgs implement their own protocols.
      * Standard observatory protocol
        * Command protocol to configure and interact with instrument: IEEE-1451, OGC Sensor Panning service
        * Standard data format
        * Standard metadata format
      * Implement driver to sit between sensor and host.
        * Driver on host, non-standard instrument firmware
          * Advantages
            -Can accommodate very diverse instruments
            -Instrument firmware is immune to observatory protocol changes.
          * Disadvantages
            -Driver devel is complex
            -Driver must be installed and configured on instrument host
            -Firmware may not conform to observatory standard.
          * WHo writes the driver?
         * Standard instrument firmware
           * Instrument and its data/metadata automatically integrated into observatory without driver. Low cost to integrate
           * Comprehensive standard spec can be complex.
            - Implementers mst understand spec.
            - Firmware implementation can be complex
            - Reference implementation needed
           * Observatory protocol standards are still evolving.
             - Need to update firmware
             - Embedded programming
             - How to update on deployed instruments.
         * PUCK
           * Provides a [http://www.mbari.org/pw/puckProtocol_1_3.pdf protocol] and container to store instrument-related info.
           * No restrictions on payload content or format.
             - Instrument driver code, calibration, metadata, ect
           * Enables plug and work for RS-232 oceanographic instruments
           * Simple, robust. 12 commands: Write, read, erase
           * Steps to update
             - Plug in instruments
             - Operator tells host instrument plugged in
             - Host applies power to port
             - Host executes driver
             - Driver handles client requests.
            * Does not define ho wto acquire data, configure instrument
            * Does not define instrument metadata beyond minimal PUCK header.
            * Does not define sensor data structure
            * 4 mfgs have implemented PUCK in firmware
            * 2-4 weeks of implementation into sensor  
            * Does not change existing software
            * Deployed on MOOS moored observatory, MARS cable to shore
          * SIAM
            * Drivers to provide standard network interface to diverse serial instruments through generic Java interface. 
            * Portable. Compatible with low power/low bandwidth moorings
            * Integration with IEEE and OGC standards
              - IEEE 1451.0 is HTTP based standard interface for interactiing with instruments. Integrated into OGC sensor web enablement
          * PUCK protocol patented. Royalty free license. Will be submitted as OGC standard.
