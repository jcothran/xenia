#summary project update notes

= SQLiteGeo (April 8, 2008) =

There is a geospatially enabled version of Sqilte labeled SQLiteGeo available at http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite Would recommend using this version of sqlite for its geospatial and shapefile support.

= monthly/latest file db replication script (April 10, 2008) =

This [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/monthly_latest_copy source code] shows how I'm using my [http://www.carocoops.org/obskml/feeds/xenia/archive/latest.sql latest.sql] hourly feed to create/populate [http://carocoops.org/seacoos_data/sqlite monthly archive file db's and a latest db].  The amount total amount of observation data currently collected is around 20 MB per day, so a month file should be around 20 MB*30 days = 600 MB

= sqlite version 3 (May 31, 2008) =

Simplified the sqlite schema [http://www.carocoops.org/obskml/microwfs/db_xenia_v3_sqlite.sql main schema] by removing tables which have been unutilized thus far (quality_control, collection) and adding a 'metadata' table which provides a simple xml file lookup mechanism associated with various table row_id's.  On the pro-side this means that platform, sensor, qc, etc configs can change independently of the basic RDB schema, on the con side I'll be depending on a limited set of xml schema conventions and hardcoding to these various schemas(as opposed to hardtabling I guess).

The metadata table is just a simple file pointer to supporting descriptive xml files of certain useful xml schema conventions.  The same metadata_id could appear on several rows as a way of providing an archival trail of changes to the same type file using the fields 'begin_date' and 'end_date' to determine the effective date range and 'active' to determine the latest (and only) active metadata record.  By this way, the database reference integrity is preserved while allowing simpler files and their attributes to change over time.

My current thinking regarding the metadata xml files is to use one each for platform, sensor and qc.  So changes to one sensor only effect that one file.  Also thinking to use a filename convention of filename_begindate_enddate.xml 

The earlier 'collection' table could be referenced as a sub element schema structure within each of these other parent schemas.

Also removed 'm_desc' from the multi_obs table.
