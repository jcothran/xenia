#summary notes for providing data to our systems
<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

We can attempt to cross-display others links to data or data maps or observations within our system catalogs or displays as our personnel time, and server/storage capacity allow.  Internally in the past we have focused mostly on near real-time observation data feeds, but can cross-reference other map points and displays as able.

We recommend coastal/ocean in-situ data providers that will have near real-time observations registering their wind and water ongoing to register their platforms with [http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/ NDBC] - or let us know if they want us to proxy/forward their data feed to NDBC for them.

Similarly for data archives, we recommend archive agreements with [http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ NODC] for long-term data storage and sharing - or let us know if we should act as a proxy/forward for their data to NODC.

= Placemark links(URL'S) =

  * notice as to nature of links(URL's) are to
    * near real-time(past 24 hours)
    * delayed-mode
    * archival data
    * model data 
  * organization
    * long name and short name - e.g. Florida Institute of Technology (long name) or FIT(short name)
    * URL link
    * (optional) - description(1000 char max)
    * (optional) - data dessimination/credit description(1000 char)
    * (optional) - data disclaimer description(1000 char)
  * location id/name(s - short format(50 char)) - e.g. cap2,sebastian,niwolmet
    * location(s) longitude/latitude
  * preferred format for sending this link mapping data is as a CSV or shapefile
  * notice as to observation types - water temperature,wind,etc

= Simple In-situ data = 

  * organization
    * long name and short name - e.g. Florida Institute of Technology (long name) or FIT(short name)
    * URL link
    * (optional) - description(1000 char max)
    * (optional) - data dessimination/credit description(1000 char)
    * (optional) - data disclaimer description(1000 char)
  * platform id/name(s - short format(50 char)) - e.g. cap2,sebastian,niwolmet
    * platform(s) longitude/latitude
  * Size and format of files to be shared and frequency of update
    * timestamp information should be included with each observation or set of observations
  * HTTP folder location from which to get the most recent files - this folder should only hold the past few days worth of files to prevent a large number of files being scanned - older files can be moved to an older or julian day/week or month/year dated sub-folders 
  * notice as to observation types - water temperature,wind,etc

= Imagery data = 

We do not permanently archive imagery data, but we can cross-display map imagery for a limited time window and associated data/bandwidth size.  Imagery data is assumed to cover a simple longitude/latitude bounding box area with default projection of EPSG:4326

  * organization
    * long name and short name - e.g. Florida Institute of Technology (long name) or FIT(short name)
    * URL link
    * (optional) - description(1000 char max)
    * (optional) - data dessimination/credit description(1000 char)
    * (optional) - data disclaimer description(1000 char)
  * data/layer long name and short name - e.g. sea_surface_temperature (long name) or sst(short name)
  * data/layer description(1000 char)
  * Size of files to be shared and frequency of update
  * HTTP folder location from which to get the most recent files - this folder should only hold the past few days worth of files to prevent a large number of files being scanned - older files can be moved to an older or julian day/week or month/year dated sub-folders 
  * image timestamp information(variablename_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS.png) should be suffixed in the filename, suchas sst_2011_05_14_13_00_00.png
  * metadata associated with the image should be available in a projection.txt file or sent via email - such as the lat/long bounding box for the image and associated projection if not default EPSG:4326
  * legend information for the image should be provided in a separate legend.png file

= Model data = 

The recommended method for sharing gridded model data is via a netCDF format, catalog enabled via [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/THREDDS/ THREDDS] and map visualization enabled via [http://www.resc.rdg.ac.uk/trac/ncWMS/ ncWMS]

Sample associated organization and model metadata and links, thumbnails are listed below(maximum number of characters in parenthesis) - one row for each data variable/layer and can be seen in the model inventory webpage at http://secoora.org/models/
