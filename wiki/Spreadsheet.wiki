#summary discussion about Google spreadsheets as templates for simple,common metadata application, infrastructure and sharing via data API

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

= Intro =

I've been experimenting some with Google spreadsheets lately and I did not realize that it includes a back-end data API for gathering/updating spreadsheet data.

A common issue from an IT perspective is that we are constantly trying to move and reformat Excel spreadsheet data (both data and metadata) from research projects/instrumentation logs into relational databases or other formats that are easier to work with and manage.

Turns out that google spreadsheets could be shared among a list of collaborators with a Google account(which can be aliased against an existing non-gmail email address). Spreadsheet info could be published for public viewing/access or kept private to the group of document collaborators.

Spreadsheets include a revision history so that if someone accidentally messed up the wrong sheet/tow/cell, we could correct using the earlier revision.  The revision capacity could also be used for provenance, time comparison purposes.

Best of all spreadsheets include an easy to use developer data API(supporting a variety of languages) that includes 'RESTful' data access/edit and some visualization capabilities via community-contributed 'gadgets'.

I really like this approach as I think it would allow people to contribute easily on the front-end using a familiar approach (spreadsheets) while also allowing us automated access and display/report capabilities on the back-end. Might also allow us to bypass relational databases/sqlite altogether in regards to diverse but relatively low-volume metadata with the focus being on finding spreadsheet content layouts and visualizations/reports that are commonly useful.

== spreadsheet design ==

see 
  * location [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text Well-Known Text(WKT)]
  * time [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 ISO8601]

conventions
  * spreadsheet name should include templateName_versionNumber like 'SecooraSensorInventory_v1.0'
  * column header names use no whitespace, camelCase convention

  * the *notes* sheet is special in the the only field descriptions are id and value which can be utilized more programmatically or free-form notes anywhere in the 3rd column or greater.  The 'templateURL' points to additional information regarding the template design/conventions, registries of other same formatted templates or scripts/links which style the template into other maps, reports or products
  * the *type* sheet is special in that the only field description is *id* and the number of row elements varies depending on the possible type values for a given id 

  * field/column names are strings or numbers unless field name suffixed by
    * *Type* - indicates a Type lookup value which should be one of the associated row values on the 'type' sheet
    * *Id* - indicates a row Id lookup value which should be on the associated Id sheet list
    * stated another way, a *Type* has a single possible value lookup while an *Id* might have several row associated values
  * sheets suffixed *Type* correspond to row id associated *!TypeId* references from other sheets (like sensor.sensorTypeId references sensorType.id)

  * if *Date* is used as a fieldname suffix, it implies a YYYY-MM-DD formatted day
  * if *Time* is used as a fieldname suffix, it implies an ISO8601 formatted datetime

  * common sheet fields
    * *id*
      * required as first column on each sheet
      * id's must be unique within each sheet
      * may be autonumbered or string

    * *URL* - URL link to further webpage info/links
    * *description* - free-form verbiage description

    * *longitude* - decimal degrees East
    * *latitude* - decimal degrees North
    * *locationWKT* - Well-Known Text(WKT) representation of points and/or lines and/or polygons using decimal degrees and meters height(+)/depth(-) to mean sea level(MSL)
    * *locationDescription* - free-form verbiage describing location

    * *timeSpanList* - list of ISO8601 ranges like '2009-02-01T14:00:00Z/2009-02-02T14:00:00Z,2009-03-01T14:00:00Z/2009-03-02T14:00:00Z'
      * if seasonally repeating will accept 'XXXX' for the year like 'XXXX-02-01T14:00:00Z/XXXX-03-01T14:00:00Z' denoting a repeat span every February
    * *timeStart* - ISO8601 formatted time, like '2009-02-01T14:00:00Z'
    * *timeEnd* - ISO8601 formatted time, like '2009-02-01T14:00:00Z'

  * spreadsheet may be extended by additional sheets or fields and be template compliant as long as no sheets or fields are removed
  * _spreadsheet column color guide (required, optional) ?_

Platforms KMZ file http://carocoops.org/spreadsheet/si.kmz
  * Google Maps http://maps.google.com/?q=http://carocoops.org/spreadsheet/si.kmz
  * note that the above kmz file is best viewed in Google Earth as Google Maps does not support the [http://code.google.com/p/kml-samples/issues/detail?id=1#makechanges visibility] tag at this time, causing all the placemarks to be displayed on the initial load of the file

=== To Do ===

  * add observationType to platform descriptions
  * provide separate kmz layers by observationType
  * provide separate kmz layers styled by online/offline similar to NDBC status map
  * provide separate kmz layer denoting longer-term operational/funding issues/concerns

== !TimeMap ==
!TimeMap includes a scrollable timeslider element to google maps that changes the placemarks according to the time window.

== !MarkerCluster ==
!MarkerCluster pools a large number(hundreds) of placemarks into single cluster which can be expanded to improve map performance.

Sharing the following *experimental* technical browser/javascript/JSON based application link from Paul Reuter working with SCCOOS.

It shows live boat tracking via an AIS message stream(click the 'start streaming' button below the map).

From Paul's email:

One more really nice thing about JSON is it's intrinsic web-based push capability.  Seen here, http://app.lightstreamer.com/GridDemo/ is an example of using an embedded iframe and inline scripting to execute a function upon receiving real-time data.  Their API is a bit more complex, but the results are a scalable, high-volume, high-connectivity application with bandwidth throttling and real-time push/pull capability.  From the Web Developer Toolbar -> View Javascript.

I personally use an iframe+inline scripting for updating real-time AIS tracks on Google Maps.  If I had parsed my data on the server, I would create JSON objects, rather than provide the raw data as a means of reducing the client-side load.  See: http://cordc.ucsd.edu/projects/ais/  (click the start streaming button).  The AIS feed is about 15 messages per second, and incurs a fair amount of client-side scripting - be forewarned.

Just throwing that out there, in case anyone hasn't seen a real-time web app yet.
