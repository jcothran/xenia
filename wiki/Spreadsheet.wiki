#summary discussion about Google spreadsheets as templates for simple,common metadata application, infrastructure and sharing via data API

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

= Intro =

I've been experimenting some with Google spreadsheets lately and I did not realize that it includes a back-end data API for gathering spreadsheet data.

A common issue from an IT perspective is that we are constantly trying to move and reformat Excel spreadsheet data (both data and metadata) from research projects/instrumentation logs into relational databases or other formats that are easier to work with and manage.

Turns out that google spreadsheets could be shared among a list of collaborators with a Google account(which can be aliased against an existing non-gmail email address). Spreadsheet info could be published for public viewing/access or kept private to the group of document collaborators.

Spreadsheets include a revision history so that if someone accidentally messed up the wrong sheet/tow/cell, we could correct using the earlier revision.

Best of all spreadsheets include an easy to use developer data API(supporting a variety of languages) that includes data access/edit and some visualization capabilities via community-contributed 'gadgets'.

I really like this approach as I think it would allow people to contribute easily on the front-end using a familiar approach (spreadsheets) while also allowing us automated access and display/report capabilities on the back-end. Might also allow us to bypass relational databases/sqlite altogether in regards to diverse but relatively low-volume metadata with the focus being on finding spreadsheet content layouts and visualizations/reports that are commonly useful.

Captures basic metadata regarding organization, platformList, sensorList, sensorTypes with linkages to further custom spreadsheets via MetadataId field

  * sheets are suffixed by 'List' or 'Type'(which futher describes List elements) or neither(table with single row)

== !TimeMap ==
!TimeMap includes a scrollable timeslider element to google maps that changes the placemarks according to the time window.

== !MarkerCluster ==
!MarkerCluster pools a large number(hundreds) of placemarks into single cluster which can be expanded to improve map performance.

== Jquery ==
Jquery is an open javascript library which simplifies javascript development including cross-browser compatibility

== real-time boat tracking ==

Sharing the following *experimental* technical browser/javascript/JSON based application link from Paul Reuter working with SCCOOS.

It shows live boat tracking via an AIS message stream(click the 'start streaming' button below the map).

From Paul's email:

One more really nice thing about JSON is it's intrinsic web-based push capability.  Seen here, http://app.lightstreamer.com/GridDemo/ is an example of using an embedded iframe and inline scripting to execute a function upon receiving real-time data.  Their API is a bit more complex, but the results are a scalable, high-volume, high-connectivity application with bandwidth throttling and real-time push/pull capability.  From the Web Developer Toolbar -> View Javascript.

I personally use an iframe+inline scripting for updating real-time AIS tracks on Google Maps.  If I had parsed my data on the server, I would create JSON objects, rather than provide the raw data as a means of reducing the client-side load.  See: http://cordc.ucsd.edu/projects/ais/  (click the start streaming button).  The AIS feed is about 15 messages per second, and incurs a fair amount of client-side scripting - be forewarned.

Just throwing that out there, in case anyone hasn't seen a real-time web app yet.
