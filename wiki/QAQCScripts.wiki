#summary Details on the QAQC processing scripts.

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

= Introduction =

The QAQC processing is based around the QAQC documentation that came out of QARTOD meetings and distilled into a [http://trac.secoora.org/datamgmt/browser/docs/whitepapers/trunk/SEACOOS%20QA-QC%20Standards%20and%20Procedures%20Whitepaper.doc paper] by Sara Haines.
I've implemented the algorithms in a set of python scripts.

  === qaqcChecks.py ===
  This file is a wrapper script that has various command line parameters that control how/what QAQC is processed.
