#summary Process for backing up VMWare Images via ghettoVCB

= Introduction =

[http://communities.vmware.com/docs/DOC-8760 ghettoVCB] is a script that resides in the ESXi host which can backup your VMWare images to a NAS devices.

= Server setup =
We're running a mixture of ESXi 4.0 and ESXi 5.0 host servers. To get ghettoVCB to work, the ssh port must be open to have console access to the OS.
== Enabling SSH Console Access ==
  * ESXi 4.0, [http://www.vm-help.com/esx40i/ESXi_enable_SSH.php here] are the instructions I followed.
  * ESXi 5.0, [http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?cmd=displayKC&docType=kc&docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1&externalId=2004746 here] are the instructions I followed.

== Setup on ESXi ==
Although I did not specifically see this in the ghettoVCB documentation, many users had posted to the forum that directories not under /vmfs/volumes were deleted under a reboot. For our setups, I created a backup directory under /vmfs/volumes/datastore1/backup where I placed the various pieces:
  * ghettoVCB.sh - Backup shell script
  * daily_list.txt - configuration file for the script that has settings specific for the daily backups
  * weekly_list.txt - config file for the weekly backups.

There is no crontab editor such as crontab -e in ESXi, instead you directly edit the file: /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root . The setup is the same as a normal *Nix cron job.

== Backup location ==
Our .112 NAS is the location the VM images are copied to. The directories are:
  * daily - /taurus/vmbackups/mnt_backup 
  * weekly - /taurus/vmbackups/weekly (not yet enabled)
