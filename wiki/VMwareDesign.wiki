= Security = 

_Try to keep the distributed image as secure as possible._

As an image or clone, any security weaknesses in one copy will be present in all copies until the image security issue is addressed or the image patched and updated.

Any personal/institutional information or passwords should not be included as part of the distributed image.

= Storage = 

_Try to keep the distributed image physical disk size as small as possible._

Relevant applications and software should be included on the image, but large associated datasets should be referenced off-image with documentation regarding access as a separate link or download.
