#summary documentation of platform/sensor status pages

<wiki:toc max_depth="6" />

= Introduction =

An overview of the platform and sensor status pages used for review and update of the real-time in-situ platform and sensor data or system checks collected and monitored by the Xenia database.

Note that these status pages may fail to represent the *true* availability or status of recent data or other resources for a variety of reasons from problems with servers or software internally to problems with networking between servers or telemetry of data from platforms.  These status pages are intended to help find problems in collection or sharing of data/resources and provide additional automated reporting metrics where helpful.

Note also that the concept of a 'platform' has been extended to a more generalized placeholder for any resource which we might want to monitor and notify on such as 

  * hf radar array system such as 'skio.array.radar'
  * remotesensing hourly map images WMS such as 'usf.oi_sst.rs'
  * modeling image WMS such as 'nccoos.sabgom.model'

== Status codes ==

Automatically set, manual update
  * *inactive* - no recent data in the past 2 weeks
  * *active* - recent data available (within the past 4 hours)
  * *technical difficulty* - recent data unavailable (no data in past 4 hours)

Manually set/update
  * *offline* - platform/sensor is expected to be offline for an extended period of time(several days or more)
  * *archival* - platform/sensor has been permanently removed from service
  * *delayed, non real-time* - platform/sensor does not collect data in real-time
  * *planned* - platform/sensor is planned for a future deployment

Where tables are presented in the webpages, rows are sortable by clicking on the associated column heading.

=== Platform update ===

The status of platforms(the circled platform link) or sensors which are not 'active' are shown in this table.  Each platform row can have the following fields manually changed or populated
  * Status - one of the status codes
  * Expected Resume Date
  * Comments - a free-form text field to describe technical issues,etc
  * Updated By - the author of this update

At the end of each platform row is an 'Update' button - clicking this updates the database only with the changes for that row.  If there are multiple rows which need to be updated, click the update button for each corresponding row.

Clicking on an individual platform name(the circled platform name) will show the associated sensors for that platform(shown in the next shot).

=== Platform update(no issues) ===

An example platform which is not currently having any reporting issues.  Note there is a select drop-down box in the upper right corner to choose a different data provider/operator and the 'all' status link to see 'all' platform status - active as well as otherwise
