#summary geospatially enabled version of sqlite

=Overview=
[http://http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/ SpatiaLite] is an extension implementing OpenGIS on a SQLite database.

==Programmatically Invoking SpatiaLite==
SQLite supports the ability to load external extensions via 'load_extension'. You can construct an SQL statement 'SELECT load_extension("libspatialite-2.dll")' to invoke the SpatiaLite extension. By default, however, 'load_extension' is disabled in SQLite, you need to be able to call the C API routine 'sqlite3_enable_load_extension' to enable it.
==Perl==
The downside I found is the DBI driver for SQLite in Perl does not support load_extension, nor does it have an interface to call the C routine 'sqlite3_enable_load_extension' which enables the ability to use 'load_extension'. So in short, there does not appear to be a way to use SpatiaLite via the DBD:SQLite driver in Perl. There are other SQLite DB interfaces in Perl, so one of those may have this ability.
==Python==
The pysqlite module for Python, does in fact support the 'load_extension' ability.
Here is a sample to get it up and running, this is on my windows machine(note the DLLs reside in the same directory as the script):
{{{
  from pysqlite2 import dbapi2 as sqlite

  DB = sqlite.connect( './html_content.db' )
  DB.enable_load_extension(True)
  DB.execute( 'SELECT load_extension("libspatialite-2.dll")' )
  DBCursor = DB.cursor()
}}}
