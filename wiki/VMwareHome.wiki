#summary vmware home page

Developed a vmware appliance/image of the Xenia relational database and associated scripts and products for free community use, download and modification.

The latest vmware image(version 1.0, rar-compressed size x) is available at http://carocoops.org/vmware/x

This vmware image was developed on top of the FOSS geospatial vmware image(geostatistics package which includes 'R') available at http://gisvm.com - thanks to Ricardo Pinho.

While the Xenia scripts do not directly utilize/interact those included applications, I thought they represent the best existing development base of FOSS geospatial software for future development.
