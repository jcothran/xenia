#summary vmware home page

Developed a vmware appliance/image of the Xenia relational database and associated scripts and products for free community use, download and modification.  The current default Xenia setup uses a combination of perl scripts and sqlite relational database to process approximately 10,000 observations per hour.

The latest vmware image(version 1.0, rar-compressed size x) is available at http://carocoops.org/vmware/x

This vmware image was developed on top of the FOSS geospatial vmware image(geostatistics package which includes 'R') available at http://gisvm.com - thanks to Ricardo Pinho.

While the Xenia scripts do not directly utilize/interact those included applications in the gisvm image at this time, I thought they represent the best existing collection of FOSS geospatial software for future development.
