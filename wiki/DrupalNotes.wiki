#summary Some notes on Drupal configuration.

= Introduction =

This page will contain some notes to various gotchas and setup parameters I've run across with my limited Drupal experience.


= Details =

== Database configuration ==
[http://drupal.org/documentation/install/create-database Here] is the page on the Drupal site on the steps needed to get the database configured.
After doing this, I took a copy of the working SECOORA database and imported it using the following mysql command:
{{{
mysql -u <username> -p <databasename> < <sqlfilename>

<username> is the username created for Drupal to access the database.
<databasename> is the name of the database for Drupal
<sqlfilename> is the exported SQL file of the production SECOORA website that gets backed up every night.
}}}

== File paths ==

=== settings.php ===
In the /sites/default/settings.php file, we need to configure a couple of items for our test system.
  * $db_url = 'mysql://username:password@localhost/databasename';
  This is the connection string drupal uses to connect to the mysql database.
  * $base_url = 'http://129.252.139.80/drupal/htdocs'; 
  Since I use a subdirectory in my /var/www directory to house the test system, I need to tell drupal what the base URL to use.

=== .htaccess ===
Have to configure a RewriteBase to tell Drupal where the base directory is going to be. If I don't do this, the relative paths to images will not work.
