#summary set of perl scripts and sqlite database for apache web log analysis

Developed these scripts out of frustration with other freely available web analysis packages including Google Analytics lately which has been having problems lately with how statistics are reported(documented [http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Analytics/thread?tid=77847d39560ae940&fid=77847d39560ae94000045dd9df11662b&hl=en here])  Mainly I am looking for more than just total hits, but also to filter and cross reference content with its users and references.

source code http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/#svn/trunk/sqlite/web_stats

Create sqlite database web_stats.db using [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/web_stats/create_web_stats.sql create_web_stats.sql] or use existing created(unpopulated) at [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/web_stats/web_stats.db web_stats.db]

apache web log input or script [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/web_stats/web_stats.v2.pl web_stats.v2.pl] should be modified to pull apache record fields (see @record variable) in same format as 

[http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/web_stats/web_stats.v2.pl web_stats.v2.pl] can also be modified to ignore particular ip,page,agent,referer arguments and filter page content, etc

secondary analysis scripts can have 'min*_' variables set to other minimum thresholds

{{{
#general flow
move log files(suffixed .log) to be analyzed to subfolder 'log' within scripts folder

no duplicate row checking/indexes on table cross_ref_info
so delete cross_ref_info rows depending on date overlap? 
#to see latest cross_ref_info.page_date row processed
select * from cross_ref_info order by page_date desc limit 1;

#populate lookup tables and cross_ref_info table
perl web_stats.v2.pl > logfile &

#mark significant ip's for host/dns lookup    
perl update_host_lkp.pl    
perl update_host_info.pl

#set analysis date_range,min_page/ip/ref
#generates set of report .txt files
perl report_cross_ref.pl
