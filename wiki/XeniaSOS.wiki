#summary SOS (Sensor Observing Service) related Xenia development/documentation

= [XeniaSOS#difSOS difSOS] =

Built a CGI based script based on earlier work with the [XeniaPackageSqlite#MicroWFS microWFS] effort, substituting a xenia database schema specific sql query and associated [http://ioos.noaa.gov/program/DIFdocs.html DIF] SOS response instead of the earlier more generic query and WFS response.

The CGI based difSOS instance is available at

http://carocoops.org/obskml/scripts/difSOS.html

The above html script calls the cgi script documented at [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/sos/difSOS.cgi difSOS.cgi] which runs queries against the earlier established xenia sqlite database.  *Note that the sql request statement of this script could be modified to provide a similar resultset/functionality from other relational database schemas or resultsets.*

[http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/sos/difSOSConf.xml difSOSConf.xml] is the modified xml configuration support xml

Note:

   * data is across a variety of data providers nationally for the latest 3 day period(time window could be enlarged as needed) - archival julian weekly sqlite files are available at http://carocoops.org/seacoos_data/sqlite/weekly
   * observation elevation datum is optional or assumed MSL(Mean Sea Level)
   * the sensorID is related to an internal database/system frame of reference and not related to any developing or recognized community sensorID reference
   * the OBSERVEDPROPERTY parameter assumes one sensor per platform (for now)
   * the OBSERVEDPROPERTY parameter only specifies a single parameter (for now)
   * the xml response is xml/text only (for now) and the response can be quite large depending on the query - would like to eventually provide a zipped response or file link for large responses ?

= minimal dataflow setup =

   * Convert [http://nautilus.baruch.sc.edu/twiki_dmcc/bin/view/Main/ObsKMLGenerate#Sample_cases raw data to obskml]
   * Convert [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/import_export/obskml_to_xenia_sqlite.pl obskml to xenia schema(sql)]
   * Use [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/sos difSOS.cgi] script to provide DIF SOS web service
