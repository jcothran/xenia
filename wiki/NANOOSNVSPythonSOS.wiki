= Python SOS for NANOOS NVS NRT in-situ Assets =

This is a temporary scratch pad for documenting the IOOS Python SOS server developed recently by [http://nanoos.org NANOOS] (first by CMOP, then enhanced by APL-UW). Note that this code has *no relationship at all* to the [http://www.oostethys.org/downloads/sos-cookbook-python/pysos-version-0.1 older Python SOS server that was also developed by CMOP / NANOOS, around 2007/2008]; That code is basically orphaned, as far as we know.

*_The new server is not official yet, but will be soon (by early Nov 2011). So, the information and data from these responses are intended for testing only!_*

Here are some sample requests and responses. Explanations will be added later.

  # *GetCapabilities*
    * Fully explicit request:  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&version=1.0.0&request=GetCapabilities]
    * Minimalist version, with defaults:  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py]
  # *DescribeSensor*
    * Fully explicit request:  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&version=1.0.0&request=DescribeSensor&procedure=urn:ioos:station:nanoos:ORCA_Hoodsport&outputFormat=text/xml;subtype="sensorML/1.0.1"]
    * Minimalist version, with defaults and short names (not full urn's):  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&request=DescribeSensor&procedure=ORCA_Hoodsport]
    * Request just the OperationsMetadata section of the GetCapabilities response:  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&request=GetCapabilities&sections=OperationsMetadata]
  # *GetObservation*
    * Fully explicit request, for latest data:  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&version=1.0.0&request=GetObservation&offering=urn:ioos:station:nanoos:ORCA_Hoodsport&observedProperty=http://mmisw.org/ont/cf/parameter/sea_water_temperature&responseFormat=text/plain]
    * Minimalist version, with defaults and short names (not full urn's):  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&request=GetObservation&offering=ORCA_Hoodsport&observedProperty=sea_water_temperature&responseFormat=text/plain]
    * Another Minimalist request, but specifying a time interval:  [http://habu.apl.washington.edu/pyws/sos.py?service=SOS&request=GetObservation&offering=ORCA_Twanoh&observedProperty=mass_concentration_of_oxygen_in_sea_water&eventTime=2011-10-18T00:00Z/2011-10-20T23:00Z&responseFormat=text/plain]

Our intent is to release the code, eventually, when we've cleaned it up and documented it just enough.

I also intend to document conventions used (IOOS conventions), with links to where they're specified; when something seemed ambiguous, I'll try to describe the rationale behind decisions made.
