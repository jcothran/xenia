= Simple schema = 

Below example is more flat/array oriented like netCDF,CSV and could support moving platforms(ships,gliders) as well as stationary ones.

  * elevRel is the 'relative elevation' in meters height(+) or depth(-) from the given GeoJSON z coordinate(s) with zero z coordinate corresponding to mean sea level(MSL).
  * The ordering of effected list arguments is in time increasing order(oldest first, latest last) allowing picking off the latest value be grabbing the last associated set of time/values off the list.
  * Stationary platforms would use GeoJSON 'Point' type and mobile platforms would use 'MultiPoint' type.  Multipoint coordinates are paired with listed time values.
  * (optional) Observation listing order is preferred to be from highest elevation/altitude to lowest elevation/depth.
  * (optional) Redundant sensors/observations would be listed in their order of importance (primary, secondary, etc) or depth(highest to lowest elevation).

= Simple schema version 2 =

Below is another revision to the initial ObsJSON schema, which treats each platform sensor as a feature with associated geometries,properties and utilizing list association between geometry/time/value per feature/sensor.

  * Geometry z coordinate is relative to mean sea level(MSL) with height(+) or depth(-) in meters.
  * The ordering of effected list arguments is in time increasing order(oldest first, latest last) allowing picking off the latest value be grabbing the last associated set of time/values off the list.
  * Stationary platforms would use GeoJSON 'Point' type and mobile platforms would use '!MultiPoint' type.  !MultiPoint coordinates are paired with listed time values.
  * (optional ?) All fields under 'FeatureCollection' are optional except platformId.  Think the other fields give some more self-contained minimal context,usage but all these could be linked in some way via the platformId reference.
  * (optional ?) sensorId is optional but would provide a means of association for related time-series or sensor metadata.

== Potential issues ==

  * Traditional request/response approaches are single-obs centric(give me just water_temperature for platform/area) rather than platform/sensor-centric(give me everything for a given platform)
  * How good/complete are request/response from SOS,ERDDAP,etc for 'all' recent platform data?
  * How would KML/javascript styling support possible JSON/GeoJSON

= Simple schema version 3 =

The below schema is flattened as much as possible, dropping the GeoJSON nesting/list and time/value list.  Would be very similar schema-wise to [http://www.ogcnetwork.net/node/189 WFS Simple GetFeature] (thanks Raj Singh for the reminder/link regarding WFS Simple) or the earlier example ERDDAP GeoJSON response(thanks Roy Mendelssohn) below.

= Suggestions =

== dictionary URI, platformType(systemType) ==

----
suggested by Luis Bermudez

1)  if we were going to make this dictionary available for  the semantic web we should have a base URI. I think, all the values you have,  will not have problems of  being part of a URI ( they have no spaces etc ..).

Could you define a base URI ? It could be for example:

http://nautilus.baruch.sc.edu/obsjson/secoora_dictionary.json

I know  expressing the URI may appear unnecessary, but if we have this file in another location (e.g. locally), it will help us going back to it and will be easier to creating an RDF from it.

2) There is no platform type (which  I prefer to call it system type ). I think this is important if we want to categorize observations by source and even putting nice icons.
----

_dictionary URI example_

For platformType(systemType) property, the simplest initial values I'd imagine would be 'fixed' or 'mobile'.  Could reference developed lookup list from others as suggested.

== Known issues ==

Jeremy will address

  * some platforms repeat multiple times
  * some wind_from_direction reporting > 360 degrees
  * order sensor listing to match elevation ? top to bottom?
  * will add 'describeSensorURL' to platform metadata JSON

Pete ?

  * label y-value splits may have a large number of decimal places(19.000000003) - can style to 2 or 3 decimals max?
  * safe to show all graphs with no time axis?  need filler/blank graph values if only one or two observations in past 24 hours?  some platforms sampling more/less than once per hour.

= Simple schema version 5 = 

The below is the most compact form I can currently think of, using a leading 'platform' set of data which does not contain a uom or values but does provide a list of location and time points which are inherited by other sensors in the listing that do not contain a location or time list.  Each sensor could contain an 'elevation' if included that specifies the elevation above(+) or below(-) the platform location in meters.  I'm doubtful that this qualifies as GeoJSON at this point, but it should be very minimal data transfer for cases - the only other additional compression step past this that comes to mind for now would be for cases where large sets of platform data(say greater than 100 platforms requested at once), to provide id lookup tables(organization,platform,sensor types, carocoops = 12, air_temperature = 23 for example) as json and use integer id lookups within the repeated data listings instead of the full string listing.
