= Download vmware image (xeniavm) =

The current download location for the associated files for the latest xeniavm vmware image are at 

http://129.252.37.86/vmware/

Due to the large filesize of the .vmdk image (3 Gigabyte compressed, 16 Gigabyte uncompressed), this file has been split into smaller files(multiaa,multiab) which can be rejoined after downloading using the Unix 'cat' command like below:

{{{cat multi* > xeniavm20090722.vmdk}}}

The 'cat' command for the Windows environment can be downloaded from http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/UnxUtils.zip

Or optionally on Windows, as suggested by Ricardo Pinho(thanks Ricardo!) use the copy command instead of cat. From a DOS command prompt: {{{copy /b multiaa+multiab xeniavm20090722.vmdk}}}

On a side note, apache can be configured to display/share file links larger than 2 Gigabytes but must be compiled with that option(CFLAGS="-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/www) see http://yoebaik.blogspot.com/2007/11/large-file-support-for-apache.html

The unix *[http://www.techiecorner.com/107/how-to-split-large-file-into-several-smaller-files-linux/ split]* command(shown below) was used to generate the smaller sized files<br/>
{{{split --bytes=2000m xeniavm20090722.vmdk multi}}}
