#summary QAQC issues and Xenia implementation

The Xenia schema currently has the following fields on the multi_obs table for tracking some basic QAQC type information.
{{{
#table multi_obs
qc_id
qc_level
qc_flag
}}}

= qc_level, qc_flag =

In reference to the qc_level and qc_flag fields, also see the [http://trac.secoora.org/datamgmt/browser/docs/whitepapers/trunk/SEACOOS%20QA-QC%20Standards%20and%20Procedures%20Whitepaper.doc SECOORA QAQC documentation]

The valid values for the high/overview qc_level flag are easiest to discuss.  It represents an integer field with one of the following five possible values.
{{{
VALUE	CONDITION
-9	the data field is missing a value
0	the data quality is not evaluated
1	the data quality is bad
2	the data quality is questionable or suspect
3	the data quality is good
}}}

For the qc_flag, the below set of tests have been suggested, with the first two (data availability, sensor range) required.  An encoding has not been agreed upon.

{{{
#QA/QC Tests
Data Availability
Sensor Range
Gross Range
Climatological Range
Rate of Change
Nearest Neighbor
Other Comparison (described in qc metadata record documentation link)
}}}

My suggestion would be to use a position-dependent string encoding (*test not evaluated = 0, test fail = 1, test pass = 3*) as to mimic the qc_level settings.

Where the string qc_level = '3330000' would represent data which passed the first three tests for data availability, sensor range, gross range and the other tests were unevaluated.

qc_level = '3010000' would represent data which passed the first test, sensor range not evaluated and gross range test fail.

= qc_id = 

_section under development_

The qc_id is a integer referencing a primary key row on the table metadata.row_id and its associated metadata fields.  The following would be a suggested sample metadata record for an ongoing quality control application.

{{{
#table metadata
row_id = 1

}}}
