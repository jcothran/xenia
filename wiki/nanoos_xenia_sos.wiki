_Implementation of Xenia OOSTethys SOS Perl server on NANOOS Xenia RDB_

We are implementing GoMOOS/Eric Bridger's [http://code.google.com/p/oostethys/source/browse/#svn/trunk/component/server/perl Perl SOS server] on the NANOOS Xenia data base we're developing. This SOS server is currently only running within our firewall at APL, for testing purposes.

While the code I've adapted originally came from Eric, I got it via Jeremy Cothran (SECOORA) and Xiaoyin Qi (Carolinas RCOOS); this code is available at [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaSOS Jeremy's Xenia repository]. They made [http://groups.google.com/group/xeniavm/browse_thread/thread/37618beca6d0a159 some adaptations to Eric's code for PostgreSQL-Xenia] which made it easier to get going.
