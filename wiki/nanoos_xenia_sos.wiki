#Implementation of Xenia OOSTethys SOS Perl server on NANOOS Xenia RDB

= NANOOS Xenia OOSTethys SOS Perl server =

We are implementing GoMOOS/Eric Bridger's [http://code.google.com/p/oostethys/source/browse/#svn/trunk/component/server/perl Perl SOS server] on the NANOOS Xenia data base we're developing at APL. This SOS server is currently only running within our firewall at APL, for testing purposes.

oostethys_sos.cgi

While the code I've adapted originally came from Eric, I got it via Jeremy Cothran (SECOORA) and Xiaoyin Qi (Carolinas RCOOS); this code is available at [http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaSOS Jeremy's Xenia repository]. They made [http://groups.google.com/group/xeniavm/browse_thread/thread/37618beca6d0a159 some adaptations to Eric's code for PostgreSQL-Xenia] which made it easier to get going.
