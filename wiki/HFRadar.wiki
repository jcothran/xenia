= ascii totals to netcdf =

The perl scripts to convert from wera ascii total files(the final total current speed/direction of the combined radial data) to seacoos grid netcdf are at the following link

http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fscout%2Ftrunk%2Fhfradar

'latest.txt' is a sample latest ascii total file received.

'convert_latest.pl' reads through the ascii file and pushes the values into arrays which are then printed back out into variables which are substituted into the netcdf file template(template_radar.txt) substituting on the file macros like <EASTWARD_CURRENT>,etc.  ncgen converts from the ascii netcdf to the binary netcdf.

There are a few initial setup steps with the netcdf template file - the provider/file name(or metadata like contact info,etc) should be substituted as needed.  Also to place the longitude/latitude of the grid points correctly, the upper/left corner point,grid size and spacing(distance in kilometers) is referenced from the ascii total file and used in the file lat_long.pl to generate the latitude and longitude points manually substituted into the netcdf template file.
