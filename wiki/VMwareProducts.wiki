#summary various formats/products and services supported by the Xenia vmware instance

[VMwareHome]

*If running/testing a local xenia vmware instance, see [VMwareProductsLocal] which replaces http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu with http://localhost in the below URLs to see the locally produced results.*

If running a final production instance for reference by others via the web, replace http references with your web http production http address.

= Google Earth/Maps, Latest ObsKML, Styled KML =

[http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaProducts#Google_Earth_and_Maps original documentation ] 

A script runs once an hour to take the latest observations and create a
  * Combined
    * ObsKML latest [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/xenia_obskml_latest.kml KML] and [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/xenia_obskml_latest.kmz KMZ] files for resharing
    * A [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/latest_placemarks.kmz styled KMZ] version of these combined observations for display in Google Earth/Maps,etc
    * An [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/archive/ archive] of the last 24 hours of styled KMZ files is available also
  * By Organization
    * A [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/wq/wq_latest_placemarks.kmz styled KMZ] version of each organizations observations for display in Google Earth/Maps,etc
    * An [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/wq/archive/ archive] of the last 24 hours of styled KMZ files is available also

Note the above KML/KMZ styling has the following features:
  
  * *layer folders toggle on/off by operator*(visualize individual operator/data provider status)
    * platform styling highlights non-reporting platforms as shaded red - platform link information still available.  Don't want platforms or observation to disappear from the map if they are intermittently reporting.
  * *by 'operator' layer* listing *all* the latest observations available at each platform
  * *by 'observation' layer* listing observations of the same obs_type.uom_type for *all* associated platforms
    * acts as a observation type 'inventory'
    * optional style.xml to provide basic default blue/green/red color scale for obs_type.uom_type measurement value range limit
  * *naming/reference hierarchy*
    * platform = operator.platform<.package> where operator and platform names are controlled vocabularies and package name is optional unique string
    * sensor = sensor_id (an integer id) = obs_type.uom_type.s_order  s_order is an integer counter to help distinguish between redundant or profiling sensor arrays of the same obs_type.uom_type
  * a feature which I would like to implement is use of *regions* to help break the entire layer into more manageable data blocks/levels of detail for *better download/display* concerns similar in concept to the Google Maps implementation at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/gmap3 or using some automated solution possibly like http://www.mapeed.com

----
Note that the time window control can be manipulated (moved, increased, decreased) - see the following documentation 

http://earth.google.com/userguide/v4/ug_gps.html#timeline

ObsKML can be merged and revisualized as shown in the following image

----
= time-series graphs =

http://xenia.googlecode.com/files/time_series.jpg

Simple time-series graphs of the previous days observations are available as web links embedded within the KML and HTML table stub displays

----
= GeoRSS = 

http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/georss

http://xenia.googlecode.com/files/georss.jpg

GeoRSS provides a simple geospatially referenced RSS feed for simple harvesting/redisplay of latest observations for each platform as a data feed.  Above feed displays correctly in Firefox browser.

----
= html table styling = 

http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/html_tables

http://xenia.googlecode.com/files/html_table.jpg

HTML platform table stubs are suitable for dynamic webpage popups via AJAX type calls

[http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/html_tables/html_content.db html_content.db sqlite table] also populated available for use.

see http://nautilus.baruch.sc.edu/twiki_dmcc/bin/view/Main/CarolinasCoastNotesAjax

----
= convert from ObsKML to other formats (CSV,shapefile) =

Currently just all the latest observations combined, will add 'by obs' and shapefile later

http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/all_latest.csv

http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/all_latest.csv.zip

----
= Data source files - zipped ObsKML and SQL =

A [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/all_metadata_latest.zip zip file] of all the ObsKML imported to the database and a [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/feeds/latest_raw.sql SQL file] of the ObsKML as converted to SQL INSERT statements.  Either source could be used to populate other copy xenia instances.  

----
= Latest 3 day database and julian weekly archive databases = 

Sqlite file download for priming, analysis, etc of the latest 3 day time window [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/archive_db/latest.db database] and [http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/archive_db/weekly/ folder] containing the julian-weekly-split archive of sqlite databases.

----
= SOS =

== DIF ==

http://neptune.baruch.sc.edu/xenia/sos/difSOS.html

XML responses should display correctly within Firefox, IE browsers

An OGC SOS(OpenGeospatial Consortium [http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sos Sensor Observation Service]) web service method supports queries on the database

= Flow/Feed status and notification = 

[http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaUpdates#flow_monitor original documentation]

A script is run once an hour 
  * to check that the data feeds have not dropped below threshold levels(if so an email notification is sent)
  * to generate a graph(past several days) of
    * recent observation flow
    * low count magnified flow
    * archival database flow
