# NANOOS Xenia Implementation at APL-UW ("XAN") #

[APL-UW](http://www.apl.washington.edu/) has adapted [SECOORA's Xenia schema](http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaHome) for its [NANOOS](http://www.nanoos.org) in-situ database, created in 2009 to complement [CMOP's](http://www.stccmop.org/datamart/) NANOOS in-situ database; these two databases together now make up the primary repository of in-situ marine monitoring supported by NANOOS in the Pacific NW. In general, CMOP focuses on data from the Columbia estuary while APL-UW focuses on data from Washington state, but these are only loose distinctions and there's geographical overlap.

I've been informally referring to this Xenia implementation as **XAN** (_Xenia APL-NANOOS_); it's a convenient -- but unofficial -- acronym. I implemented and adapted the Xenia data model for PostgreSQL. It's been running on Ubuntu Linux 10.04/12.04 with PostgreSQL 8.4. I will gradually add documentation and discussions on this page, but for now here's what I have:
  * 9/20/2013: [Database model documentation presented as a very nice, navigable collection of schemas, tables, views, schema diagrams, etc (basically all database elements).](http://habu.apl.washington.edu/mayorga/xan/dbdoc_dbw/index.html) Exported from PostgreSQL using [DbWrench](http://www.dbwrench.com).
  * From 2010: [Schema diagram for the "core" tables](http://habu.apl.washington.edu/mayorga/xan/XAN2_dev_PgAdmin110_DataModel.gif) (organized in a PostgreSQL schema called "core"). Not all joins are shown.
  * From 2010: [Schema diagram for geospatial (PostGIS-enabled) and supporting tables](http://habu.apl.washington.edu/mayorga/xan/xan_geo_DataModel.gif) (organized in a PostgreSQL schema called "geo"). These are generated automatically from tables in the core schema. The Observation Series Catalog shown here is actually a view, but this view just adds fields from joined look-up tables to the main table that's auto-updated. The joins shown on this diagram are only for documentation; they're not actually implemented on the database (because the tables are auto-updated, there's just no need to formally define the referential constraints).
  * A presentation I gave on 2010/2/22 at the [Ocean Sciences 2010 meeting](http://www.agu.org/meetings/os10/) in Portland, OR: ["Regional to local IOOS Data Management and Interoperability: Perspective from the Trenches (NANOOS, US Pacific NW)"](http://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/SFgate/SFgate?language=English&verbose=0&listenv=table&application=os10&convert=&converthl=&refinequery=&formintern=&formextern=&transquery=au%3dmayorga&_lines=&multiple=0&descriptor=%2fdata%2fepubs%2fwais%2findexes%2fos10%2fos10|816|4893|Regional%20to%20local%20IOOS%20Data%20Management%20and%20Interoperability:%20Perspective%20from%20the%20Trenches%20%28NANOOS%2c%20US%20Pacific%20NW%29|HTML|localhost:0|%2fdata%2fepubs%2fwais%2findexes%2fos10%2fos10|274797%20279690%20%2fdata2%2fepubs%2fwais%2fdata%2fos10%2fos10.txt). Here's the [powerpoint presentation (11 MB)](http://habu.apl.washington.edu/mayorga/xan/Mayorga_OceanSci2010_NANOOSAPL_DataManagement.ppt).


We don't yet have a comprehensive, online data access and visualization application for all datasets in XAN, but one of these datasets ([PRISM Cruises, Puget Sound, WA](http://prism.washington.edu)) is available from a component (a "web app") of the [NANOOS Visualization System (NVS)](http://nvs.nanoos.org/CruisePrism).

On a tangential but related note, [here are some old discussions on the implementation of the OOSTethys Perl SOS server on top of XAN](http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/nanoos_xenia_sos). This SOS server for XAN is no longer being developed, so these discussions may be of limited value.
