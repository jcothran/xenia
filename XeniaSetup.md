# Choose Database Version #

To get a secondary sqlite (see XeniaPackageSqlite ) instance going, simply copy the most 'recent' database at http://carocoops.org/seacoos_data/sqlite/latest.db and then hourly populate with the hourly refreshed 'latest.sql' at http://www.carocoops.org/obskml/feeds/xenia/archive/latest.sql

Getting a secondary postgresql (see XeniaPackageV2 ) instance going should be the same in regards to the ongoing population with the latest.sql file, but one will need to setup the initial postgresql instance using the documentation at http://code.google.com/p/xenia/wiki/XeniaPackageV2#Install_Notes
