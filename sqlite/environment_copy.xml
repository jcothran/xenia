<!-- the following 3 elements (dir_tmp_cpy_local,dir_tmp_cpy_host,dir_cpy) could contain the same directory value where everything is running on the same server.  The below example shows a shared tmp directory between two servers which is used for running a cpy file against a separate server database instance and the final dir_cpy is where the cpy files are archived. Remember that for remote database instances the filepaths are relative to the remote server. -->
