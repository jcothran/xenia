**Note - this is an out-of-date wiki page, the latest Xenia features are listed at [VMwareProducts](VMwareProducts.md)**



Xenia uses ObsKML as a default XML import/export format.  Some of the following products are derived purely via ObsKML which means that they are equally applicable to scripts which can supply ObsKML whether from a Xenia instance or otherwise.

Some of the following scripts utilize a combination of ObsKML and additional XML lookup files.

Some of the following scripts run against the Xenia db directly.

Latest placemarks

http://carocoops.org/gearth/latest_placemarks.kmz

Note the above KML/KMZ styling has the following features:

  * **layer folders toggle on/off by operator**(visualize individual operator/data provider status)
    * platform styling highlights non-reporting platforms as shaded red - platform link information still available.  Don't want platforms or observation to disappear from the map if they are intermittently reporting.
  * **by 'operator' layer** listing **all** the latest observations available at each platform
  * **by 'observation' layer** listing observations of the same obs\_type.uom\_type for **all** associated platforms
    * acts as a observation type 'inventory'
    * optional style.xml to provide basic default blue/green/red color scale for obs\_type.uom\_type measurement value range limit
  * **naming/reference hierarchy**
    * platform = operator.platform<.package> where operator and platform names are controlled vocabularies and package name is optional unique string
    * sensor = sensor\_id (an integer id) = obs\_type.uom\_type.s\_order  s\_order is an integer counter to help distinguish between redundant or profiling sensor arrays of the same obs\_type.uom\_type
  * a feature which I would like to implement is use of **regions** to help break the entire layer into more manageable data blocks/levels of detail for **better download/display** concerns similar in concept to the Google Maps implementation at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/gmap3 or using some automated solution possibly like http://www.mapeed.com
