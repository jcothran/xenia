see the readme.txt file for the sqlite version currently at http://code.google.com/p/xenia/source/browse/trunk/sqlite/time_series/readme.txt - the postgresql version is essentially the same except for the file graphSingleLine.pl which makes the database connection and query

note also in the environment file to include the necessary database connection elements like db_name,db_passwd, etc
